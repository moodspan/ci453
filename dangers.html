                <h2>Privacy in business information systems</h2>
                <p>Businesses have changed many aspects of how they operate due to the introduction of network technologies, which allow 
                    them to frequently share data and store it throughout connected networks. This has made businesses work a lot more 
                    efficiently, but there are some downsides to this, such as:</p>

                <h3>Data theft/manipulation</h3>
                <p> The altering or theft of private information is essentially fraudulent cyber activity, usually done with malicious 
                    intent. The user doesnâ€™t straight away steal the data, they alter and modify it to damage the organization.
                </p>

                <h3>Computer viruses</h3>
                <p> A business' operation can be easily disrupted by malware, as the malicious code can give attackers access to all 
                    files and programs and are even the ability to reformat the computer itself, erasing everything, possibly causing a 
                    hard crash of the system completely. Viruses are mostly used by hackers who have malicious intent to either steal or
                    destroy private data.

                <h3>Computer fraud</h3>
                <p> Computer fraud can be a great threat to a business. This is an act of using a computer to steal/alter data or to 
                    gain access, without authorisation, to a computer system. Under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 it is an offence to
                    use a computer to perform functions with the intent to access unauthorized programs or data that is held within a 
                    computer.

                <h2>Security controls for mitigating privacy threats</h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the various potential privacy threats, many laws have been put in place in order to hold people accountable
                    for their malicious actions. However, due to the damage often caused by these attacks, it is best to try to prevent 
                    them from happening in the first place. Some of the techniques used include:
                </p>

                <h2>Securing internet connections</h2>
                <img class="right" src="images/connection.jpg" alt="connection">
                <p>Internet connections can never be completely safe. They should be secured using different mechanisms, e.g., audit logs, 
                    firewalls etc. Another way to protect internet connections is by equipping the internet router with packet filters to 
                    control the flow of outgoing and incoming packets. Backing up these filters with a firewall tends to strengthen the 
                    security of the connection by stopping any suspicious data that comes through. Monitoring the connection also makes 
                    for good security, seeing what data goes through. This can be achieved by using Host and Network IDS (Intrusion 
                    Detection System) devices. These devices can monitor different devices and servers to detect and identify an 
                    intrusion of malware within the network.</p>

                <h2>Securing public servers</h2>
                <img class="right" src="images/server.jpg" alt = "server">
                <p>Companies require the use of public servers that can be accessed via the Internet. For these servers to be safe from 
                    other networks, a demilitarized zone network (DMZ) should be placed. This adds an extra layer of protection, however 
                    the administrators themselves also play a role in protecting the server. For administrators to secure their businesses servers, 
                    they require up to date operating systems and applications, which should be able to deal with any intrusion. Likewise, scripts 
                    should be checked thoroughly just in case a security leak should happen. Overall, a businesses public server should be equipped 
                    with the latest firewall software, which can also be configured to protect itself from DoS attacks (Denial of Service attack).</p>
